      <p class="one">Hello and welcome to my Jazz Apprecation Website! My name is Louis Barnes and I am a senior at Saint Louis University High School. As you probably saw at the homepage, I play the trombone. As I was given this assignment, I decided that Jazz would be the best thing for this website to be about.</p>

      <p class="one">Anyway, I hope that you have a nice day. I know this isn' t the best looking of websites, but 960 grid is hard to understand and this is the best I can do. Enjoy yourself, live life, and don't forget to smell the flowers! Jazz is a wonderful thing that should be appreciated, which I am doing. They sure don't make Jazz like they used to.</p>
